# LaserficheWorkflowExportToCSV
This code allows you to easily export any data, whether it be a single line or an array of information into a CSV file, 
which can be emailed or further manipulated.
//
This project is ideal for exporting data directly from SQL/Laserfiche Forms Process/search results in yourLaserfiche Repository 
into a CSV file.
(There are, in some cases, better alternatives. I have found having this in your Workflow Designer and understanding how it works can defintely be helpful).
